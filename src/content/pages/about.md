My name is Todd Lambert and I have been working professionally in the web industry since 1999. I have a lot of relevant experience in a variety of aspects of both the design and development sectors of the business. I've worked as a webmaster, web designer, front-end developer and user interface engineer within a wide array of clients and industries.

Although I have worked for many companies as an employee, I started my career with my own company and as an independent contractor. Because of this, I have always considered client relationships as a unique partnership with the goal of obtaining the customers online objectives first and foremost.

Because of this interaction on both sides, I have become adept at key aspects of identifying/solving problems and designing flexible solutions that are tailored to the clients needs. I can often spot a potential issue and plan for accommodating it before it becomes a change order or bug report. This expedites the overall processes and lessens the complexity of the development cycle.

I am self-taught and to this day I still strive to learn as much as possible. I began with basic html and css and then added javascript and php. Following those, I worked with analytical data and testing in order to obtain the best results possible. Through a/b and user interaction testing I have learned that what you believe as "best practice", may not always be so.

Because of my needs as a solo developer to deliver products that my clients could maintain themselves, I began working with Content Management Systems to facitate this. I began with Moveable Type and then when a new project called WordPress began, I moved over to that and never looked back.

I have since learned all aspects of WordPress development and theming and plugins. I am really excited by the new features of the platform with regards to GraphQL and React JS.

As of late, I have begun learning React and have recently ventured into SSGs such as Gatsby and the JAM Stack. Although this is quite different to WordPress, I honestly see this as the future of web development as customers expect more and more performant products.

Learning new technologies and working with new clients has been the cornerstone of my career and I don't see that changing any time soon.
One of my greatest obstacles has always been my shy nature and overcoming that has been a constant challenge throughout my life. I've found that teaching technologies and explaining the processes helps me to overcome this.

By learning new things, one grows. I read a lot online and love the Internet as it has allowed me to build my skills and further my career. My favorite places are Smashing Magazine, Dev.to, and the Live To Code magazine on Flipboard.

When I'm not at my computer I love to photograph. I am an accomplished night photographer and my work can be viewed at my website:
