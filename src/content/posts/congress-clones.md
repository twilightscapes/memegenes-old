## U.S. Senators announce new system to extend their service terms forever


<blockquote>
This is going to revolutionize the halls of congress. No longer will we have to lose our beloved members of the ruling class, to time. Democracy will be FOREVER!
<br /><span style="font-size:80%;">- Nancy Pelosi says about the new CCC plans.</span>
 </blockquote>


Pelosi and McConnell recently underwent advanced new procedures that they hope will make their political legacies last forever.

Technicians have prepared their bodies for cryopreservation, or Congressional Cloning Cryonics (from Greek: κρύος kryos meaning 'cold'), which is the low-temperature freezing (usually at 196 °C or −320.8 °F or 77.1 K) and storage of human remains, with plans for resurrection whenever there may be a need. 

Thus enabling members of congress to hold  office indefinitely.

The Senators argue that as long as brain structure remains intact, there is no fundamental barrier, given our current understanding of physical law, to recovering its information content. The Senators may be going further than the mainstream consensus in saying that the brain does not have to be continuously active to survive or retain memory.

They controversially claim that a human survives even within an inactive brain that has been badly damaged, provided that original encoding of memory and personality can, in theory, be adequately inferred and reconstituted from what structure remains.

They insist that with this new understanding of available technolgies, they can be revived each term, and ensure that their memory, personality, and most importantly, their voting records can be permanantly maintained.
