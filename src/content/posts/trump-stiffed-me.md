  "I'm starting to think Trump stiffed me and I don't know what to do" He still owes me over seven thousand dollars for pillows, as he claims he was told by Trump to "order lots and lots of pillows as Mar-A-Lago patrons would love them".

Mike Lindell, the founder and CEO of MyPillow claims recently that he had a deal to stock Mar-A-Lago with his companys pillows and other products.
<br /><br />
He claims he was told by Trump to "order lots and lots of pillows as Mar-A-Lago patrons would love them". Mike says he brought his best slippers and pillows and gave them to everybody. But now Mike complains that he has yet to be paid for his products.
<br /><br />
Mike Lindell says Trump never paid for MyPillows used at Mar-A-Lago during a promotion involved with January 6th planning. 
<br /><br />
Mike's company MyPillow has recently fallen on hard times with the CEO spending all of the working capital on things like his own Television channel, FrankTV and paying for bets he made on the Internet. Many of his employees now hate his guts due to his political activism and support of former President Donald Trump.


<blockquote>He still owes me over seven thousand dollars for pillows</blockquote>

"and he owes me another four thousand for slippers!!" said Mike angrily talking about his former bestie and largest customer.
<br /><br />
"I'm starting to think Trump stiffed me and I don't know what to do" said Mike looking dismayed as he fumbled with a purple fidget spinner.
<br /><br />
Recently there have been reports of Mike selling all of his companys equipment in auctions for quick cash. 
<br /><br />
Apparently, he has also hocked his entire collection of Trump and Melania NFTs in order to make payroll after paying a Million settlement he lost recently.
<br /><br />
"He's completely ran this company into the ground because of a guy that wouldn't piss on him if he was on fire" says one disgruntled employee who is on work furlough and waiting to get paid himself.
