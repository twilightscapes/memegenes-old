## BANG! You're Dead

So, there was a guy named Alec who was a commedian who pretends to be a tough guy. One day, he decided to take his friend Bob up on an offer for a hunting trip. Alec had never handled a gun before and was excited to learn.

Bob handed Alec a gun and explained how to load it, aim it, and shoot it. Alec was nervous but eager to try it out. As they were walking through the woods, they heard a rustling sound in the bushes. Bob whispered to Alec, "Get ready, aim, and fire!"

Alec raised the gun, aimed it in the direction of the sound, and pulled the trigger. To his surprise, instead of a loud bang, there was only a quiet "pfft" sound, and a small flag popped out of the barrel with the word "Bang!" written on it.

Alec was confused, but Bob started laughing hysterically. "You just got pranked, my friend! That's a novelty gun I got as a gag gift. It doesn't shoot real bullets, just confetti and flags."

Alec was relieved that he hadn't accidentally shot someone, and they both had a good laugh about the practical joke.

Alec made sure to ask more questions before handling any more guns.

Again, it's important to treat guns with respect and caution. If you're new to handling firearms, always seek proper training and guidance from experienced professionals.
