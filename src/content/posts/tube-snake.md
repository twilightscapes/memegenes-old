## Across the state of Alabama, there are seedy little spots that cater to a unique fetish 


Dozens of gay men have come forward to reveal a dirty little secret that Tommy Tuberville has been hiding. 

 An all new movement involving an agressive form of line-dancing has taken Alabama by storm in small local clubs and bars.



<blockquote>
Tommy loves doing the Tube Snake Boogey!
<br /><span style="font-size:80%;">- former partner claims</span>
 </blockquote>

"I first met Tom in the lobby bar of the Trump Hotel, where he was cutting quite the rug. He was wearing a garish outfit that looked like it had been made from the American flag, but he was moving about in ways that I had never seen before" says "Jimbo", a frequent partner of Tubervilles. 
<blockquote>
Tommy always wants his favorite: the ""Tommy Two-Step Tussel" - he goes nuts for it!!
<br /><span style="font-size:80%;">- says one of Tommy's numerous partners</span> </blockquote>
"I've been around this game long enough to know that guys like Tommy are a real rarity nowadays. But there is something about his pelvic energy, his wild eyes and southern-fried speech, that intrigues me. I have follow him for a while, he's aways grinding away with everybody at most of the local dives" says Kenneth, a regular at the clubs that Tommy frequents.
<blockquote>
He loves it when we call him Tommy Two-Toned or Tommy Tubular. He always ends his moves with a short grunt and exclaims "That's going Tubular, man!"
<br /><br /><span style="font-size:80%;"> - remarks Gary, another of Tuberville's regulars.</span> </blockquote>

It turns out that Tommy Tuberville is quite the frequent customer and has a large following of fans that often meet to see Tommy's Cross Shuffle and Heel Stomps.

His moves like the Pencil Turn and the Mash Potato keep them all calling for more.
