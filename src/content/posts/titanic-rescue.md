On June 19, 2023, a tourist submarine operated by OceanGate Expeditions went missing while on a mission to the wreckage of the Titanic. The sub, which is called the Cyclops, was carrying five people: three tourists and two crew members. 

<div class="" style="font-size:clamp(2rem, 3vw, 3.8rem); padding:0; text-align:center; width:80%; height:; overflow:visible; margin:5vh auto; border-radius:12px;">The submarine lost contact with the surface after an hour and 45 minutes underwater.</div>



The U.S. Coast Guard launched a search and rescue operation, and the Canadian Coast Guard also assisted. The search was hampered by the fact that the submarine was operating in a remote area of the North Atlantic, about 900 miles east of Cape Cod, Massachusetts.

After about 12 hours, the submarine was finally located and rescued. The cause of the submarine's disappearance is still under investigation, but it is believed that a technical problem may have caused the loss of communication.

One witness reported that they saw "weird lights all around them" and that they were "wooshed around like they were flying".
