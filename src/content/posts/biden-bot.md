## Disney announces that President Biden will become a semi-permanent cast member in the Hall of Presidents feature for a limited Summer engagement


<br />
President Biden has made fun plans for this summers activities and has decided that he wants to "fix some things" about his favorite ride at Disney, which is the Hall Of Presidents.

Starting immediately, Disney has made sure that Joe has been given carte blanche authority to make changes to the wildly popular attraction.

Joe has already announced changes to the sections containing his predecessor's likeness and we're told that those sections will be soon removed or renovated. 

<blockquote>"Joe insists on doing his sections himself and without any animatronics which the feature normally makes use of" said a spokesperson.</blockquote>

"He really gets into it, and will perform the entire bit himself and he does it so well, the audience doesn't even notice!"

Currently, Biden is performing at the park for the foreseeable future, or as he says "Come hell or high water, Jack..." or at least until the White House "Cools down, like a flap, Jack..." says the President in using his inside voice.

Disney has started to run promotions utilizing the President to help revitalize the beleaguered attraction. A spokesperson said "these days, nobody wants to see the Hall of Presidents, they'd rather view the other attractions".

But Biden has reportedly proposed some big changes for the attraction. His plans to "mesh BattleBots with the Hall of Presidents" is being heralded as a huge win with test audiences who love the new carnage scenes that involve the 45th President. 

Stay tuned as we try to get access to the new test screenings.
